// if js document is placed at the head section, the whole js document needs to be wrapped in function of document.on("ready") or document.ready

// By doing this, when all elements have been loaded. The jquery files will kick in.

// The further shorthand from above is just wrapping all content in $(function(){ js content })

// The other similar command is window.load() or window.on("load"). This will wait for the entire page to load, including images.
